{"lyrics":"In my head, I play a supercut of us\r\nAll the magic we gave off\r\nAll the love we had and lost\r\nAnd in my head\r\nThe visions never stop\r\nThese ribbons wrap me up\n\nBut when I reach for you\n\nThere's just a supercut\n\n\n\nIn your car, the radio up\n\nIn your car, the radio up\n\nWe keep trying to talk about us\n\nI'm someone you maybe might love\n\nI'll be your quiet afternoon crush\n\nBe your violent overnight rush\n\nMake you crazy over my touch\n\n\n\nBut it's just a supercut of us\n\nSupercut of us\n\nOh it's just a supercut of us\n\nSupercut of us\n\n\n\nSo I fall\n\nInto continents and cars\n\nAll the stages and the stars\n\nI turn all of it\n\nTo just a supercut\n\n\n\nCause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)\n\nWhen you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)\n\nBecause ours (are the moments I play in the dark)\n\nWe were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh\n\n\n\nIn your car, the radio up\n\nIn your car, the radio up\n\nWe keep trying to talk about us\n\nI'm someone you maybe might love\n\nI'll be your quiet afternoon crush\n\nBe your violent overnight rush\n\nMake you crazy over my touch\n\n\n\nBut it's just a supercut of us\n\nSupercut of us\n\nOh it's just a supercut of us\n\nSupercut of us\n\nBut it's just a supercut of us\n\nSupercut of us\n\nOh it's just a supercut of us\n\nSupercut of us\n\n\n\nCause in my head, in my head, I do everything right\n\nWhen you call I'll forgive and not fight\n\nAll the moments I play in the dark\n\nWild and fluorescent, come home to my heart\n\n\n\nCause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)\n\nWhen you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)\n\nBecause ours (are the moments I play in the dark)\n\nWe were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart\n\n\n\nCause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)\n\nWhen you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)\n\nBecause ours (are the moments I play in the dark)\n\nWe were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart\n\n\n\nIn my head, I do everything right\n\nIn my head, I do everything right"}
